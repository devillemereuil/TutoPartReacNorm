# Tutorial corresponding to the article "Partitioning the phenotypic variance of reaction norms"

This repository contains the tutorial (as an R script) corresponding to the article "Partitioning the phenotypic variance of reaction norms" (de Villemereuil & Chevin, submitted).

The tutorial uses the `tidyverse` set of libraries for the data and model wrangling, the library `brms` for the statistical analysis and the library `QGglmm` for the analysis of non-linear models.

(The tutorial currently only offers a scenario where the environment is discrete, as it is the most common case, but a "continuous" scenario is in the making as well)
